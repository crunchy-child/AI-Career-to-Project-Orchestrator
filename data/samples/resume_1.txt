PROJECTS
________________


Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Multi-agent System                                                Dec 2025 - Jan 2026
* Designed a distributed multi-agent AI system enabling autonomous agent discovery and collaboration using a standardized Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol. The project focused on replacing monolithic LLM pipelines with modular, service-based AI agents.
* Implemented a LangGraph-based reasoning agent and exposed it as a FastAPI service, allowing agents to communicate over HTTP. Introduced Agent Card JSON to support standardized agent discovery, metadata exchange, and protocol compatibility.
* Enabled agent-to-agent messaging via JSON-RPC 2.0, allowing structured and machine-readable communication between independent agents. Integrated remote sub-agents and built a user-facing orchestration agent to dynamically delegate tasks and aggregate responses.
* Applied a microservices-style architecture to AI agents, emphasizing modularity, loose coupling, and scalability. Designed the system to be extensible for capability-based routing, automated agent selection, and future distributed AI systems.
Seoul Bike Demand Prediction                                                                 June 2025
* Built and evaluated machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict hourly bike rental demand using weather and temporal features.
* Conducted extensive EDA and feature engineering with Pandas and NumPy; visualized demand patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* Tuned XGBoost with cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization, achieving MAE 962.43 and RMSE 1610.30.
* Applied SHAP for model interpretability, identifying key drivers such as temperature, rainfall, and rush-hour effects.
* Translated model insights into actionable recommendations for demand-aware resource allocation.

Data8, University of California, Berkeley Academic Intern                                        August 2023 - December 2023
* Guided 30+ students per lab in Python-based data science labs covering EDA, sampling, inference, and linear regression using the datascience module and Jupyter.
* Improved conceptual understanding by creating visual slide decks and delivering real-time explanations on topics like confidence intervals and causation vs. correlation.
* Supported autograding workflows using Otter-Grader and helped debug student notebooks in a cloud-hosted JupyterHub environment.
* Proposed new teaching strategies that enhanced student engagement and increased lab efficiency for instructors.
Green River College Math Tutor                                                                September 2021 - June 2023
* Provided academic support in arithmetic, algebra, calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, discrete math, and probability.
* Helped students at all levels by adapting explanations to their learning needs, building both foundational skills and advanced problem-solving strategies.
* Improved communication skills by explaining complex math concepts in English as an international student.
* Worked ~11 hours/week, enhancing my own understanding while supporting peers' academic growth.

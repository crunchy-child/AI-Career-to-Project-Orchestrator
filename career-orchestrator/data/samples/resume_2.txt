UC Berkeley Data Discovery x Ten Strands                                                                                           Berkeley, CA
Student Researcher                                                                                      Sep – Dec 2025
* Quantified the impact of dedicated staffing on environmental literacy, finding that districts with Whole-System Coordinators are 59.5% more likely to achieve superior performance scores.
* Analyzed correlation between political affiliation and environmental investments; discovered that Democratic-leaning districts prioritize community roles, whereas some Republican districts offer higher site-level compensation. 
* Enhanced dataset integrity for 938 CA school districts by imputing missing political data via 2020 voting shares, establishing a robust baseline for statewide longitudinal analysis.
